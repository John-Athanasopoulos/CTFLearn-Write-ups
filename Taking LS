Taking LS - Writeup

We download the .zip file and extract its components. We then open the txt file containing the password which is "Im the flag".
We then proceed to open the pdf with the name The Flag.pdf
The pdf file is locked and the password is the one we have found a moment before. So we unock the file and find the flag which is ABCTF{T3Rm1n4l_is_C00l}.
