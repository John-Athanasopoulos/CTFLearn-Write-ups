We open the website given by CTFLearn which currently is http://165.227.106.113/post.php

>We first see that it is not an actual website and rather just some plain text displayed, saying it needs information to be sent to the given url via POST-request.
>Going into the Inspector (Ctrl+Shift+I or Q), and navigating to the Inspector field, opening "body" we can see an HTML comment giving some credentials to us [username=admin|password=71urlkufpsdnlkadsf].
OR
The same thing will happen if we go to a website that makes HTTP Requests and make a GET-request to http://165.227.106.113/post.php.
>We, lastly, need to make a POST-request with the given credentials to the defaced web page, as we have been requested to do. To do this, we enter the following code to the code field:

POST / HTTP/2.0
Host: http://165.227.106.113/post.php
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13
username=admin&password=71urlkufpsdnlkadsf

This makes a POST-request to the Host (http://165.227.106.113/post.php) and assigns username to "admin" and password to "71urlkufpsdnlkadsf" in the php form of the site.
>We are now given the flag which is: flag{p0st_d4t4_4ll_d4y}

Congrats! You finished POST-Pracice!
